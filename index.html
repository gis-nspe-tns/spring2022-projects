            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The importance of trees within cities is almost common knowledge at this point, with extensive research pointing to the many health, safety, and economic benefits (among others) that trees deliver to urban neighborhoods. With this framework in mind, I hypothesized that there may be an exacerbated vulnerability within New York City communities experiencing high rates of development pressure coupled with tree cover loss, while already facing high levels of socioeconomic vulnerability. By utilizing GIS software and publicly available Census tract and land cover data, I was able to map NYC’s tree canopy change between 2010 and 2017, further comparing this data with socioeconomic risk factors gathered from the 2010 Census and the 2018 American Community Survey. While there is no apparent correlation between these two variables, this mapping exercise did reveal several areas within New York City classified with high socioeconomic vulnerability and low levels of tree cover, as well as a handful Census tracts which have faced significant tree cover loss and increasing socioeconomic vulnerability over time.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Miami-Dade County, one of the nation's most populous with 2.7 million people, is stuck. More specifically, it is the third most congested county in the country, despite having a fraction of the population of the two counties ahead of it - New York (8.5 million) and Los Angeles County (10 million). A key reason for this is the almost total lack of robust public transit in the county. There is currently one metro line that is simply not accessible to most of the county. Thankfully, there has been a plan in development for several years to radically expand the transit system, building more than 70 miles of rail that would provide a  quick, dependable, and affordable mobility option for many in the county. The goal of this GIS analysis is to better understand the current transit system to identify possible service patterns, and to then look forward and quantify the benefits that would be provided by the expansion. The analysis found that the current Metro system benefits disproportionately white residents in relatively affluent and unpopulated parts of the county. The full expansion envisioned by city leaders would significantly change this, putting 88% of residents within a mile of a train stop. Furthermore, the North and South corridors should be especially prioritized in construction, as they would serve areas of high population and poverty.</p>

              <a class="text-dark">Mapping Europe’s Migrant Crisis: Analyzing the number of Syrian and Afghan refugees and asylum seekers traveling to Eastern Europe and Turkey from 2015 to 2020</a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">In 2015, more than a million migrants crossed the Mediterranean and arrived in Europe, marking the beginning of what would become known as the worst refugee crisis to hit Europe since World War II. As the influx of migrants continued to increase, the European Union struck a deal with Turkey in 2016 seeking to limit the number of asylum seekers and shut down the Balkan route, which has long served as a link between Western and Eastern Europe. Currently, Syrians and Afghans make up two of the largest displaced populations around the world, and in Europe, with many fleeing war, instability, and conflict. As the Syrian civil war enters its 11th year and Afghanistan once again under the control of the Taliban, the migrant crisis is still ongoing and millions of lives continue to be stuck in limbo. This project aims to map the effects of the migrant crisis on 11 Eastern European countries as well as Turkey by examining the changes in the number of Syrian and Afghan refugees and asylum seekers from the start of the crisis in 2015 until 2020. This GIS analysis also seeks to assess the impact of the immigration policies enforced by the European Union and its member states on neighboring countries without EU membership and on Syrian and Afghan migration flows. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Tirana, Albania has undergone significant urban change in the past 15 years. Since 2015, however, there has been an increase in building activity. New roads are being built, the Lana River rerouted, and larger buildings are starting to dominate the landscape. In 2015 Stefano Boeri Architetti won a competition to redesign the city with a project Tirana 2030. The project looks into the ways the city has changed since the project was implemented. Using Sentinel-2 satellite false-color infrared imagery, buildings and developments are classified to find the changes in the urban fabric. Using this data, urban growth, building typologies and patterns, infrastructure improvements, demolition along the Lana River, and resettlement of Roma near the Sharra landfill are investigated.</p>

              <a class="text-dark">Mapping Green Gentrification within New York City | Paige Burr</a>
            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Over the past 20 years, gentrification has caused the displacement of low-income residents in rapidly advancing cities across the United States. While the classic markers of gentrification include the influx of new businesses and increasing rents, additional forces have been identified as possibly contributing to gentrification trends. This includes the concept of Green Gentrification which refers to the process by which property value and cost of living increase as new green spaces attract outside investors. This project aims to spatially assess if green gentrification occurs within New York City by mapping the likelihood of gentrification alongside the New York's Department of Environmental Protection implementation of green infrastructure.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Mekong Sub-Region is one amongst fast-developing global water basins. To meet growing demand for electricity in its industrial zones and growing population centers,  governments are constructing an increasing number of hydroelectric dams along the Mekong River and its tributaries. Using GIS software and publicly available data from Open Development Mekong, regional mapping was conducted to show locations of dams, power capacity and dam proximity to cities (greater than 1 million populations) and industrial zones.</p>
