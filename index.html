            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Opioid Crisis has taken more than 500,000 lives since 1999 and has only worsened in the strain of recent years. (CDC 2021) This project compares the opioid pill distribution at the height of prescriptions in 2012 to the current availability of Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT), emphasizing the lack of recovery from the ongoing opioid epidemic and the need for an equal distribution of MAT providers in vulnerable counties where pill prescribing was once high. In processing this data, a glaring gap within the middle of the country exhibits a relationship between a lack of data and lack of recovery providers, creating an image of the opioid epidemic which hasn’t yet been revealed. A multivariate analysis on all counties in the United States helps to determine risk status of a country that has been ravaged by the opioid crisis, emphasizing the gaps in recovery and data as well as weighing the most vulnerable areas.

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Colonization in the United States has burdened Indigenous land and communities with less desirable and hazardous infrastructure. Pipelines, refineries, and plants have been strategically placed to transport and process materials and substances needed to meet the demanding energy consumption of the countries in the Global North. In the United States, pipelines have been a topic of contention for decades due to their high safety risk and low monetary increase in the community that resides atop them. Refineries and plants however, can create economic value in neighboring communities, yet guarantee large amounts of released toxins which are both dangerous to the air and water of neighboring communities. This project aims to answer the question of whether Indigenous territories of the United States (lower 48 states) carry a disproportionate burden of certain energy infrastructures relative to the aggregate lower 48 United States.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The effects of climate change disproportionately fall upon vulnerable and low-income populations, predominantly within the Global South.  As the climate warms and populations suffer worsening socio-economic conditions, as well as high levels of violence and political instability, many find themselves undertaking a journey northward. According to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report, there is a high degree of confidence that climate weather extremes are driving displacement within all regions, with up to 700 million people being displaced by 2030 due to climate related stresses. The Global North, historically the largest emitters of Greenhouse Gasses, have responded to the climate crisis by increasing funding for border enforcement and militarization. According to the Missing Migrants Project, since 2014 more than 40,000 people have lost their lives in the process of migration. This project will analyze climate anomalies with migrant deaths according to the Missing Migrants Project data set. Climate anomalies for specific years will be incorporated into the analysis to see if changing temperatures have an impact upon migration death. The research will focus on two prominent routes, North Africa and the Mediterranean. Each map will look at climate anomaly, cause of death, and number of deaths within each route. Rendering visible the deaths of migrants is essential if we are to create policies and frameworks that are rooted in justice, dignity and the protection of the right of mobility.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The coming century will be hotter and introduce multiple elements of precarity for national and subnational actors, as well as individuals. The American Southwest and Mexico have faced megadroughts, forest fires, and in the case of Texas, deadly power failures. International energy relationships will be crucial for the literal survival of millions on both sides of the Texas-Mexico border. Nuclear energy, particularly MSR (molten-salt reactor) designs can fill this energy demand in a massive, and safe manner. International energy cooperation will strengthen both nations, and is a moral necessity of the United States in its relations with Mexico. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The purpose of this project is to analyze the criteria and factors that have gone into the creation of Draft Disadvantaged Communities (DACs) in New York State as designated by the 2019 Climate Act, specifically for New York City as it pertains to accessibility of green space and proximity to brownfield sites. New York City makes up almost half of the population of New York State and houses over half of the Draft DACs. Brownfield Sites are former industrial and/or commercial sites that have contaminated the environment. Green Space in this project is referred to as parks, courts, tracks, etc. that are managed by NYC. Zoning of brownfield sites has historically been near/within already vulnerable and underrepresented communities. On the other hand, access to green spaces in NYC are typically centered closer to more affluent areas. In this project, I have worked to attempt to draw a linkage between the likelihood of being a DAC and having a brownfield site within/near your community, and the accessibility of green spaces within DACs. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">India is home to 7 of the world’s 10 cities most exposed to environmental threats. In the age of rising sea-levels, extreme heat waves and rapid reduction of groundwater, we are moving towards a future of mass environmental migration. This project assesses the geographical and climate risk of the 100 proposed smart cities on a national scale. The vulnerability analysis would be done on the basis of measuring temperature anomaly, sea level rise and water risk for all cities. This will help policy makers understand the real scale of risk to consider as India builds its new cities as part of the development agenda. It will also highlight the kind of investments needed and in what sectors based on the vulnerability assessment. </p>
