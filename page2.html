            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Under strict lockdown and travel bans, many cities in China experienced dramatic, life-changing impacts due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Both work and living spaces shifted from offices, factories, and public spaces to more strictly residential areas. More people were locked down at home. Artificial lights, such as indoor lighting, car lights, captured by satellite sensors at night, reveal human activities. Therefore, we may observe changes of human activities from the lighting emission data collected by satellite images. This project visualizes and analyzes satellite imagery to reveal 'life changes' across several Chinese population centers (January 2020) and after (February 2020) the COVID-19 pandemic. The mean of brightness is the average number generated from the image pixel level, and it is the primary quantification value for this project. Using the mean brightness across country, province, and respective city centers between 2019, 2020, and 2021, this project features thematic maps to show the top 5 provinces in both brightness increasing and  brightness decreasing trends.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The Ette Ennaka Indigenous People (also known as Chimila) have been inhabiting for centuries surrounding eastern areas of the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta in the Colombian Caribbean Region. Since the Spanish conquest of the Americas, they have faced many threats to their culture and territory, which have menaced their own existence. The Colombian state, passively or actively, has played a major role by creating the conditions for land divisions in favor of individual private property, or by giving indigenous peoples land titles over their ancestral territories. After the year 2001, fuelled by regulation changes concerning mining and agrofuel projects, there was an acceleration for land access and control, encompassing surrounding Ette people´s resguardo (land owned collectively) named Issa Oristuna, and causing substantial loss of healthy vegetation (tropical dry forest). This project utilizes Sabanas de San Angel municipality as the basic unit of analysis because it is the place where most Ette Ennaka live and where their resguardo is located. It consists of overlapping vector files with relevant environmental and extractivist updated information and reclassifying satellite imagery from the year 2002 and year 2022 to identify the extent of land use change from healthy vegetation to deforested areas. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Air pollution, the improper disposal of toxic materials, environmental hazards, and climate change broadly pose significant threats to human health both in the United States and around the world. The combination of these factors, and others not mentioned, are experienced differently around the country creating both environmentally safe and risky areas or ‘zones’. Only by better understanding which areas of the country are more or less susceptible to these environmental risks, we can better plan for, adapt to and prevent the inevitable effects of climate change. Better understanding where these environmentally safe zones are located, and subsequently, where the environmentally risky zones are, is the primary goal of this project. This project utilizes geographical analysis to visually map and better understand the prevalence of these zones across the country. This analysis concludes that approximately 63.7 percent of counties within the Unites States fall within the parameters of ‘environmentally safe zones’, with 9.2 percent of counties classified as ‘environmentally safest zones’. These zones are primarily found in the center and northern parts of the country. Conversely, the analysis concludes that approximately 1.2 percent of counties in the US fall within zones of extreme environmental risk. These extremely environmentally risky zones are highly correlated with major metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles, Houston, and San Diego. These results visually illustrate the distribution of environmental risk throughout the United States and can be used to better inform local communities, national disaster responses and environmental policies around the country. </p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">The apparel industry is known for its harmful practices towards people and the planet. Companies are attempting to be more “sustainable” and “eco-friendly”, to meet a growing demand by consumers, yet, due to the structure of global supply chains, the factories themselves and their environmental risks are being left outside of the equation. In this project I wanted to demonstrate how vulnerable are apparel factories to direct climate change events such as floods and droughts, as well as the poor sanitary conditions that prevail in the areas where the factories are located. I developed a worldwide mapping of these dangers using GIS software and publicly available data from the Open Apparel Registry and World Research Institute, with a focus on the nations where the majority of the hazards occur. The results show an unequivocal correlation between the factories and environment hazards, and call for us to act upon them.</p>

            </h5>
            <p class="card-text">Climate will induce increasingly frequent weather conditions that will impact New York City in many different ways. The two most prominent problems in this particular urban area are sea-level rise induced flooding and the urban heat island effect. These extreme weather conditions not only put pressure on the residents of NYC but also on its critical infrastructure and technological systems. This project is particularly interested in the vulnerability of NYC’s energy systems to these extreme conditions. Using the QGIS software and data available from U.S. EIA and NYC Open Data, small-scale mapping is conducted to examine the extent to which critical energy infrastructures are vulnerable to extreme weather conditions. The results will show which power stations, substations, and parts of transmission lines are impacted by coastal flooding, heat stress, or both. Furthermore, potential disruptions will likely exacerbate existing social equities and health risks, thereby fueling urban health inequities and the wilder social-political stability (Friel et al. 2011). </p>

              </h5>
              <p class="card-text">Urban Tree Cover and Green Space provide a range of environmental and socio-economic benefits to urban residents, including shade and evaporative cooling, as well as providing shelter for local animals and insects.  In cities like Budapest that are heating faster than the average city in the EU due to global warming, it’s essential to supplement wider, regional map (NUTS-2) with a more granular analysis to understand some of the potential sources of mitigation that are already in place that could minimize the impact of urban heat waves at a local level. The Budapest example confirms that there is a strong correlation between growth of high surface temperature with decrease of urban tree coverage. Using the Urban Atlas repository (provided by Copernicus and the EU) and combining it with cutting-edge, practical datasets from climate change monitoring centers (such Berkeley Earth or the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts - ECMWF) provides a promising research path.   </p>
